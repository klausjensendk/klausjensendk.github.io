				Trump signaled earlier on Wednesday that he intended to issue an order instructing the Pentagon and Department of Homeland Security to open a center in order to “detain the worst criminal illegal aliens threatening the American people”.

				“Some of them are so bad, we don’t even trust the countries [of origin] to hold them because we don’t want them coming back,” he said. “So we’re going to send them out to Guantánamo. This will double our capacity immediately.”
						
				The US naval base outpost in Guantánamo Bay, in south-eastern Cuba, already has a facility used to house migrants picked up at sea, which is separate from the high-security prison for foreign terrorism suspects established in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks by Al-Qaida on the US.
						
				The secretive immigrant detention facility does not appear in public government reports, and details have only recently surfaced, including about alarming conditions. As of February 2024, four people were being held at the facility, the New York Times reported, citing the department of homeland security.
						
				Trump made the initial announcement as he signed the Laken Riley Act, which mandates the detention of undocumented immigrants charged with theft-related crimes. The act is named after a 22-year-old nursing student from Georgia who was murdered in 2023 by an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.
						
				It added: “This memorandum is issued in order to halt the border invasion, dismantle criminal cartels, and restore national sovereignty.”
						
				Trump’s order on Wednesday marks the latest effort by the new administration to fulfill the president’s promised threat to remove millions of people from the country.
						
				Writing on X, the US social media platform owned by Trump backer Elon Musk, Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla slammed “the US government’s decision to imprison migrants at the Guantánamo Naval Base, in an enclave where it created torture centers and indefinite detention”.
